### Problem 2###

# read packages 
library(tidyverse)

# load data 
raw_file = readLines(con = "suites_dw_Table1.txt")

# identify the separator line (line 14) and give it the name L
L <-
  (substr(x = raw_file, start = 1, stop = 2) == "--") %>%
  which() %>% 
  min()

# extract the variable description from the text file and store it in another
# text file
cat(raw_file[1:(L-2)], sep = "\n", file = "variable_description.txt")

# extract the variable names and store them in a new vaiable, called "variable_names"
variable_names <- 
  str_split(string = raw_file[L-1], pattern = "\\|") %>% 
  unlist() %>% 
  str_trim()

#read the data (without the variable description) and convert it to csv
comma_separated_values <- 
  raw_file[(L+1):810] %>% 
  gsub("\\|", ",", .) %>% 
  gsub(" ", "", .)

# add the variable names to the data and convert everything to a csv file
comma_separated_values_with_names <- 
  c(paste(variable_names, collapse = ","),
    comma_separated_values)

# create a new txt file that contains the csv values created above
cat(comma_separated_values_with_names, sep = "\n", file = "csv_data.txt")

#read the txt file back in 
galaxies <- read_csv("csv_data.txt")

### Problem 3 ###

library(ggplot2)

galaxies %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = a_26)) +
  geom_histogram() 
# the graph does not show the expected results. Because you can see,
# that there are more small galaxies than big galaxies in the dataset.
